			<h2>Damascus</h2>
			<p>During a transformative three-month period, I had the privilege of volunteering at a summer camp in Damascus, Ohio. This camp focused on supporting at-risk teenagers facing challenges such as broken families, street violence, and unstable environments. My role was to accompany these young individuals through daily activities and foster a positive atmosphere of inclusion and trust.

Through engaging in recreational activities, team-building exercises, and personal mentoring, I worked to help them navigate their difficult circumstances. The experience was deeply rewarding as I witnessed the growth and resilience of these teenagers, contributing to their journey toward a brighter future.

This opportunity strengthened my commitment to social impact and reinforced my belief in the power of compassion and understanding in helping others overcome adversity.</p>
