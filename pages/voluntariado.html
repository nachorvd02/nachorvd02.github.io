			<h2>Damascus</h2>
			<p>During a transformative three-month period, I had the privilege of volunteering at a summer camp in Damascus, Ohio. This camp focused on supporting at-risk teenagers facing challenges such as broken families, street violence, and unstable environments. My role was to accompany these young individuals through daily activities and foster a positive atmosphere of inclusion and trust.

Through engaging in recreational activities, team-building exercises, and personal mentoring, I worked to help them navigate their difficult circumstances. The experience was deeply rewarding as I witnessed the growth and resilience of these teenagers, contributing to their journey toward a brighter future.

This opportunity strengthened my commitment to social impact and reinforced my belief in the power of compassion and understanding in helping others overcome adversity.</p>

			<h2>Lifeteen</h2>
			<p>For several years, I have been part of a volunteer group dedicated to supporting young people aged 12-16 through weekly sessions and an annual summer camp. Every Friday, my friends and I meet with these adolescents for two hours, offering guidance and support across various aspects of their lives—social, academic, and familial.

Our sessions are designed to be engaging and meaningful, combining discussions, activities, and mentoring to help them navigate the challenges they face. We strive to create a safe and encouraging environment where they can express themselves, build confidence, and develop healthy relationships.

Each summer, we expand on this experience by organizing a week-long camp. During this time, we deepen our connections through group sessions, talks, games, and team-building exercises. The camp fosters a spirit of integration, camaraderie, and teamwork, providing the participants with an unforgettable experience of growth and belonging.

This ongoing commitment has been incredibly fulfilling, allowing me to make a positive impact on the lives of these young individuals and contribute to their journey toward a brighter future.</p>
